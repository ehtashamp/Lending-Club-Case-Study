## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
    I need to identify the patterns of the people who default the loan repayment. This is to reduce the risk of giving out loans to people who are most likely to default. Therefore, to understand the pattern in which a person is most likely to default, we can help the bank or finance companies to make smart decisions in giving out loans without losing out on the successful repayment.
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
    To understand the pattern in which a person is most likely to default, we can help the bank or finance companies to make smart decsions in giving out loans without loosing out on the succesful repayment.
